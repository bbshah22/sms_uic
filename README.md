# Open Source School Managment System

## Goal

The goal fo this repository is to create an Opensource School Managment System in the hope that schools world wide have access 
to a plataform withoout having to pay to an external company to do it for them. If you went to school to college in the developed 
world it's really likely that you are familiar with Blackboard or Piazza. This is an attempt to provide users with the same 
features and more to students accross the world.

## Objective
We want to have a feature that adds and removes features based on some configuration file. This will allow each school to
edit their application in their own way. 

So far the development of this Opensource Project is on C# using Entity Framework that connects with a database. The API is 
going to be GraphQL base and standar base as well.
